AWS Cloud Security Foundations
Hybrid Networking & Security Architecture
CCNA → AWS Cloud Security Engineering
This repository documents my enterprise networking foundation as I transition from CCNA-level infrastructure engineering toward AWS Cloud Security Engineering. It demonstrates how on-prem enterprise network security principles translate directly into AWS hybrid cloud architectures.

🎯 Project Objective
Design and implement a secure, highly available enterprise network architecture that provides:

Traffic segmentation and isolation (VLAN-based)
Redundant routing and failover (HSRP, OSPF)
Hardened management and control planes
A solid foundation for AWS hybrid connectivity (VPN / Direct Connect)

This project establishes the networking and security fundamentals required to secure AWS hybrid cloud environments.

🛡️ Security Architecture
Zero Trust Network Foundation

Port Security & DHCP Snooping (hardware trust layer)
VLAN-based segmentation (conceptually mapped to AWS Security Groups & NACLs)
Management plane hardening (SSHv2, ACL restrictions)
Least privilege access enforcement

AWS Conceptual Translation
These principles directly map to:

AWS VPC and subnet architecture
Security Group and Network ACL design
AWS Site-to-Site VPN security posture
Direct Connect private virtual interfaces


🛠️ Technical Implementation
High Availability

HSRP for default gateway redundancy
EtherChannel with LACP for link aggregation
Redundant core / distribution layer design

Routing & Connectivity

OSPF for dynamic routing
Multi-area OSPF (scalability foundation)
Prepared for future BGP integration with AWS

Traffic Control

NAT / PAT with logging
ACL-based traffic filtering
VLAN-based segmentation and isolation

🚀 Next Phase: AWS Integration (Target: Q2 2026)
Planned implementations:

AWS Site-to-Site VPN from on-prem edge to AWS VPC
Terraform modules for hybrid deployment
CloudWatch logging and monitoring integration
Security automation using Python + Boto3


📚 Skills Demonstrated
